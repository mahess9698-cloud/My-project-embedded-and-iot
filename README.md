This project is a Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using Embedded and IoT. A DHT11 sensor is used to measure temperature and humidity. The ESP8266 (NodeMCU) reads the sensor values and connects to the internet using WiFi. The collected data is sent to the cloud (ThingSpeak), where it can be viewed anytime on a mobile or computer.
